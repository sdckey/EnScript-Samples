# Additional Notes
## Storing/Resolving Iterated Case Items for Later Use 
Iterated items only exist whilst they are being iterated, so they cannot be stored in an array or linked list.

The following script demonstrates how to obtain the moniker for an evidence item, store that moniker in a SQLite database, and then use an instance of `ItemCacheClass` to resolve that moniker back to the item so it can be bookmarked.
